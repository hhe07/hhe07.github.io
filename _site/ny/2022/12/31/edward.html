<p>it’s been quite a year. and through thick and thin, you’ve been around, as someone i know i can just have a chat with, to shoot the shit, or whatever the whippersnappers these days are saying. college has been rough in patches, but i feel i can rely on you, that at least there’s someone i know who mostly wants me around. that there’s someone who will put up with my complaining, who will provide genuine insight on assignments and academic life, who i can count as a friend. thank you for providing much-needed stability in my life, and for being a great role model <em>and</em> mate (anglo definition).</p>

<p>happy new year, enjoy the rest of your break!</p>
