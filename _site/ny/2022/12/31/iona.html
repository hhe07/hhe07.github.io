<p>i’ve been meaning to do something like this in one form or another for a very long time — first, as an innocent new year’s letter at the end of last year; then, as an airing of grievances or as something to pretend to put myself back together with; and finally as a little means of wrapping things up.</p>

<p>in any case, i’m a bit better now, probably less bitter, certainly more grounded. and honestly, thank you. i wouldn’t want to go through our parting ways again, but it was an important experience. i realize it may have been hurtful for you, which makes the above seem like schadenfreude, so i’d also like to apologise for the last time. i’m sorry for my clinginess, for not letting go, and the way it all turned out. i hope we can put it all behind us.</p>

<p>speaking of, there are a few song lyrics i’ve thought about quite a bit through this process. i listened to black country new road’s <em>ants from up there</em> endlessly from february to graduation, and i think my feelings have fortunately gone from the first few songs (which captured my mood at the time) to the following —</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>concorde flies in my room <br />
tears the house to shreds <br />
defines the night as such<br />
a home for us, stick insects <br />
and leaves no trace of luck <br />
at every market town that we intersect <br />
i die, like, fifteen times <br />
a dark blue stem brings me to their breast <br />
and i’m feeling kinda normal with a packed lunch <br />
train rides don’t hurt much these days <br />
we’re all working on ourselves <br />
and we’re praying that the rest don’t mind how much we’ve changed <br />
so if you see me looking strange with a fresh style <br />
i’m still not feeling that great <br />
and then it’s in soft focus all around you <br />
you can’t see the football game <br />
on my dad’s sofa, we are still <br />
and we never look at our phones anymore <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>finally,</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>i’ll refer to you as my special love, the one that set me free <br />
so if you love me, if you love me, come clean <br />
<em>(bridge)</em> <br />
waiting around until things grow old <br />
i’m feeling lost in towns that were my home <br />
and if everything was easier before <br />
then we’ll go back to who we were <br /></p>
</blockquote>

<p>thank you. have a great new year!</p>
