    <p>As part of my ECEN 1400 (Introduction to Analog and Digital Electronics) class, I had to complete a final group project. The objective was to build some sort of working electronic device, and gain valuable experience about working in a group and the product development process. My group decided to build an adaptive Frisbee disc launcher, which was meant to help users with disabilities throw a disc with a reasonable degree of control, thus enabling them to participate in disc-based activities. We planned to accomplish this through the use of a repurposed cordless drill motor and battery, controlled by an Arduino.</p>

<p>My role in the group was to program the Arduino, but I ended up doing quite a bit of the electronics as well. I think the main technical skill I learned was the use of interrupts with the Arduino. These were connected to safety switches to turn the system off when the user put their hand in the mechanism, and worked fairly successful. I also reviewed my wood and metal shop skills (learned prevously in FRC Robotics) while helping build the enclosure for our launcher. Otherwise, I think I learned some things about the production of electronics from scratch. Previously, in robotics, while my team definitely had our fair share of hacky solutions, the majority of our electronics were pre-built, with the primary problems being the packaging and programming of the electronics. In this case, I had to start from scratch, soldering a protoboard extension for the Arduino Nano that we were using, and confirming that the electrical connections worked. I also practiced verification of the board I had constructed, even if I did fry an Arduino in the process in a last-ditch attempt to reconfigure power for the Servo. I also coordinated the construction of the sensors and sensor cables to connect to the protoboard, as well as some of the safety design of our relay setup. The core protoboard is shown below:</p>

<p>As for non-technical learning, I learned a lot about the value of communication with my team and the need to balance planning and prototyping. Other than the last few weeks, my team wasn’t particularly motivated to prototype or plan, so I undertook basically all of the planning work. I also felt somewhat alienated from the rest of the group, as my attempts to communicate fell on deaf ears, and I gradually gave up on trying to distribute and coordinate work. However, we didn’t communicate about what we wanted out of the project and our expectations, which lead to an argument between me and another group member a week before project submission. Fortunately, afterwards, I was able to smooth things over and motivate my group to put in the necessary work to complete the project. We ended up producing a decent result <em>and</em> became more friendly with each other during the process. The key lesson I took away is to neither underestimate nor overestimate my group, but to also communicate my feelings about the process early and clearly, so the group coming together isn’t something left until the last minute.</p>

<p>Overall, while the process of completing the project wasn’t the most smooth, I did learn quite a bit about the experience of working with a group, and refined some of my technical skills further.</p>
