<div class="post">
    <p>much like the software misc. page, this is partially a self-shaming so that i’ll feel obliged to work on these (not really, i wish i had the time, both are super interesting to me!).</p>

<h3 id="leaf">leaf</h3>

<p>a battery-powered bluetooth dac based on the ESP32-C3 and the PCM5102, with an e-ink display.</p>

<p>the idea came from watching dankpods and the fact that my phone’s headphone jack is steadily falling apart, preventing me from using my akg k240s more often.</p>

<p>i need to write an implementation of the ble audio profile (and understand what bluetooth profiles are) before i can actually start on this, which is going to be quite involved. this project will probably require a heavy amount of optimisation to use relatively low power and to fit all the functionality i want onto such a tiny system.</p>

<p>STATUS: paused for now (school)</p>

<h3 id="attiny-22l-fpga-implementation">attiny 22l fpga implementation</h3>

<p>i just decided it might be cool to write a processor simulator for my fpga (a <a href="https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/boolean">boolean board</a> bought for digital logic at CU). the simplest thing i could think of (with still like, a decent feature set) was an attiny 22l. i started this right before my <a href="/cs/2023/10/07/spur.html">summer research</a> so i unfortunately wasn’t able to get too far.</p>

<p>but, the digital logic class at Cornell that i’m doing two labs for (to make up computer organisation content not fulfilled by the class at CU) involves building a relatively simple processor, and i have more knowledge of computer architecture from the aforementioned research, so maybe i’ll have the knowhow and experience to finish this after!</p>
