much like the software misc. page, this is partially a self-shaming so that i'll feel obliged to work on these (not really, i wish i had the time, both are super interesting to me!).

### leaf

a battery-powered bluetooth dac based on the ESP32-C3 and the PCM5102, with an e-ink display.

the idea came from watching dankpods and the fact that my phone's headphone jack is steadily falling apart, preventing me from using my akg k240s more often.

i need to write an implementation of the ble audio profile (and understand what bluetooth profiles are) before i can actually start on this, which is going to be quite involved. this project will probably require a heavy amount of optimisation to use relatively low power and to fit all the functionality i want onto such a tiny system.

### attiny 22l fpga implementation

i just decided it might be cool to write a processor simulator for my fpga (a [boolean board](https://www.realdigital.org/hardware/boolean) bought for digital logic at CU). the simplest thing i could think of (with still like, a decent feature set) was an attiny 22l. i started this right before my [summer research]({% post_url 2023-10-7-spur %}) so i unfortunately wasn't able to get too far.

but, the digital logic class at Cornell that i'm doing two labs for (to make up computer organisation content not fulfilled by the class at CU) involves building a relatively simple processor, and i have more knowledge of computer architecture from the aforementioned research, so maybe i'll have the knowhow and experience to finish this after!
