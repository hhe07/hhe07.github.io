as seen above, ford's doing pretty well. still stimky as always but it's too cold for a bath (it's snowed so much this week)

otherwise, thanks for being one of the few friends from secondary school that apparently still recognises my fantastic value as an irredeemable piece of shit. no but seriously you're one of the few people from school (other than edward and vadim) that i talk to on a regular basis. as i embark on the career path towards becoming a divorced english dad (at least in terms of antisocial behaviour), fortunately i can rely on you to be the lynn to my partridge (minus the romantic part, i would rather date a dead fly (ironically)), the dad to my shitty useless son tribute act, the wario to my mario (or at least luigi).

okay fuck it metaphors aren't my forte. genuinely, thank you for being one of my few long-term friends, and for being there through so much this and last year. you were there for all the bridges i burned, the slivers of joy in my little dark age, and everything in between. because of you, for better and for worse, i'm alive today, somewhat healthy, and improved as a person.

happy new year!
