My final project for my introductory C++ class is basically representative of my programming abilities in C++. I think what's notable about it is not necessarily the specific code or extent of the C++ programming language that I used (since we weren't allowed to use pointers, and I hadn't learned much advanced C++), but the structure of the program and the way that I thought about the problem. For context, the final project was to build a basic RPG with some specific structural requirements, either off of a template provided by the course, or using a self-made design. I initially chose to design my own project, but I correctly recognised that my concept was not feasible by the deadline. The requirements can be found [here](https://github.com/CSCI1300-StartingComputing/CSCI1300-Fall2022/blob/main/project/project3/project3.md), but broadly involved:
- the use of some objects and student-created classes
- the use of arrays
- the use of control flow and iteration structures
- file input and output
- implementation of the required features

I was most pleased with my ability to structure the entire program in a logical and reasonably clean way. First, rather than having classes handle their own terminal output and reading of terminal inputs, I consolidated all those situations to two classes (which nested with each other). As a result, the flow of terminal data followed a segmented and clear path for debugging: the main loop read terminal data, which was then sent to a option receiver in the relevant class to be sent to the relevant method for processing, which then applied changes to the internal game data and the output objects (a ``map`` of ``string`` to ``string`` to print the menu presented to the player at a given point, and an additional ``string`` for displaying extra information).

Additionally, since I noticed that many of the classes that I had planned required access to many of the core elements of the game's data, I created an ``Assets`` class and some associated ``structs`` to load and store shared parts of the game's data from text files (such as weapon names and statistics, cookware names and statistics, a list of monsters which hadn't yet been fought, etc.), reducing code reuse for reading from files and sharing manipulated data between classes. 

Finally, I think the ``Driver`` class is notable as a successful attempt to work around some of the restrictions of the project. The better way to make a UI menu would likely be to use a map of strings to function pointers or something. Despite the length of the ``Driver`` class, the broad division of *handling* input and *modifying* output was quite good. Otherwise, I was happy about the division of features into various functions, since it confirmed some of my previous decisions in the cleanliness of the code and the level of organisation.

There are definitely shortcomings, however --- I think that a further level of abstraction is necessary in the driver, perhaps to divide the input and output functionality from some of the game logic. Otherwise, I think the frequent use of ``map`` data structures in ``Assets`` isn't the most efficient solution, because some of the code used to interface with them is somewhat clunky. Finally, I think that the output objects could be optimized. The output ``map`` needs to be cleared before every iteration, which is a significant bottleneck; and a large portion of the length of the ``Driver`` class is taken up by handling addition of menu elements to the output ``map``. I can't think of a very definite solution right now, but perhaps a binary search tree / graph would be ideal for the menu interface, and some sort of hash table / ID system would be ideal for the various ``map``s in ``Assets``.

Regardless, you can find the code and instructions for running it [here](https://github.com/hhe07/csci1300_final). I think this project is a decent representation of how far I've come in *thinking about* programming --- not necessarily the features I know how to use or the specific methods that I'm aware of, but thinking about the program *as a whole* and planning it out.
